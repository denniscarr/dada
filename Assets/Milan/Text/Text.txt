This one is for you
Don’t be ashamed
Remember to click on everything
You can’t get lost.
Even better than the last. 
You’ll pick up on it. 
You’re doing well. 
Don’t get flighty now. 
Most of the drawers are empty. 
It’s hard to understand without seeing the whole. 
There is a plan.
The grail is down there.
Don’t forget how far you’ve come. 
It’s only observable in parts. 
What are you looking for?
You’ll figure it out. 
Don’t be afraid to fall. 
What textures or impressions it might create 
Be open to frustration
Keep on moving
The world is here for you
Please try to understand
Re-enchantment is difficult
A mystical forest is difficult to recreate
Focus is difficult
Another shadow play
Try again to remember
Relentless amnesia
We grieve for the world
Stay still for a second
Don’t stop chasing your tail
