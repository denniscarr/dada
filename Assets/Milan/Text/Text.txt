This one is for you
Don’t be ashamed
Remember to click on everything
You can’t get lost.
Even better than the last. 
You’ll pick up on it. 
You’re doing well. 
Don’t get flighty now. 
Most of the drawers are empty. 
It’s hard to understand without seeing the whole. 
There is a plan.
The grail is down there.
Evohé! Evohé!
Enough!  Or too much!
Exuberance is beauty.
Don’t forget how far you’ve come. 
Why?  How?
It’s only observable in parts. 
What are you looking for?
You’ll figure it out. 
Don’t be afraid to fall. 
What textures or impressions it might create 
Be open to frustration
Keep on moving
Keep going
Don't tell me what to do
The world is here for you
Scene change: later that day
Meanwhile...
Wake up
All of a sudden...
In ruhig fliessender Bewegung
Scherzo
Andante
La Terre est un Homme
Très mouvementé et avec passion
Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso
Please try to understand
No one will cure us of the dull fire
Everything is connected.  Everything changes.
Re-enchantment is difficult
A mystical forest is difficult to recreate
Focus is difficult
Another shadow play
Try again to remember
A video game with rrrelentless amnesia
We grieve for the world
Stay still for a second
Don’t stop chasing your tail
You can never escape!
Don’t take it personally
We tried our best
Lights in the distance
Confidence is a positive
Walking is exhausting
Be honest
There’s nothing easier than falling
I want to keep this world with me
You little hermit crab
The cosmic Dhukka party continues
Take care of your shell
Numinous experiences come in twos
The mystery play goes on
Who does the grail serve?
Keep connecting each moment
That’s the way.
A world you can touch
Everything in its place
Like in the good old days
I really enjoy our intellectual conversations
Like a mediocre dream of escape
